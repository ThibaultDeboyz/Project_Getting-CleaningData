# Project_Getting-CleaningData

Data collected from the accelerometer and gyroscope of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone was retrieved, worked with, and cleaned, to prepare a tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The run_analysis.R 

This script creates a tidy data set with the following steps:

Downloading and unzipping the dataset from the internet

Reading the data 

Merging the two training and test datasets to create one larger dataset

Extracting the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

Include activity names and add them to the different activities in the dataset. 

Make a second dataset (which is also tidy) with the average of each variable per activity and per subject

Using the write.table function write the data set to the tidy_data.txt file.
